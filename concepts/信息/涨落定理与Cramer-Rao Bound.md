If we think about the statistics in the trajectory space $\{\Gamma\}$ which depends on a control parameter

$$
I(\theta)
$$
$$
\frac{p_\theta(\Gamma)}{p_\theta(\tilde{\Gamma})} = e^{s(\Gamma)}
$$
What can we learn from this?

$$
I(\theta) = \int \left(\partial_\theta \ln p_\theta(\Gamma)\right)^2d\Gamma
$$
